# GAN-Project
 Synthetic Fashion Image Generation with GANs
 
 ◦ Developed a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using TensorFlow and Python to generate synthetic images.
 
 ◦ Implemented a custom training loop to optimize model performance reducing training time by 50%

 ◦ Analyzed model performance and applying binary cross-entropy loss to enhance learning outcomes.
